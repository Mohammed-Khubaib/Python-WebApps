Subject: Invitation to Dinner Party

Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to extend an invitation to you and your family for a dinner party at our place this Saturday. It would be wonderful to catch up and spend some quality time together.

We'll be preparing a variety of dishes, including vegetarian options. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary restrictions or preferences, and we'll be happy to accommodate.

The party starts at 7:00 PM, and we look forward to having you join us. Feel free to bring a dessert or beverage if you'd like, although it's not necessary.

Looking forward to seeing you soon!

Best regards,
Sarah
